The Petrichor Pack is the 2nd original pattern from Lavender & Twine.  Itâ€™s a structured bag that easily transforms from a backpack to a crossbody bag.  Two front zippers are perfect for large cell phones, and the spacious interior has two slip pockets with decorative trim, and one large zipper pocket.
